ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka & AWS
This project demonstrates a real-time data streaming pipeline that simulates stock market data, streams it via Apache Kafka, and stores it in Amazon S3 for analytics using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Apache Kafka (on Amazon EC2)

Python for producer & consumer

Amazon S3 for storage

AWS Glue (Crawler & Data Catalog)

Amazon Athena for querying

s3fs, boto3, kafka-python

ðŸ”„ Workflow:
Producer: Simulates stock market data using Python and sends records to a Kafka topic.

Kafka Broker: Hosted on EC2, handles the real-time stream.

Consumer: Reads messages from Kafka and writes them as .json files to an S3 bucket.

Glue Crawler: Automatically catalogs the incoming data in S3.

Athena: Used to query and analyze the data using SQL.

ðŸ“Œ Use Case:
Ideal for stock analytics, real-time dashboards, event-driven architecture demos, or as a learning tool for Kafka + AWS integrations.
